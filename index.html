            <p class="text-pad"><span>Course Description: </span>An equation that contains the derivative of an unknown function is called a differential equation. The rate of change of a function at a point is defined by the derivatives of the function. A differential equation relates these derivatives with the other functions. Differential equations are mainly used in the fields of biology, physics, engineering, and many. The main purpose of the differential equation is for studying the solutions that satisfy the equations and the properties of the solutions. Let us discuss the definition, types, methods to solve the differential equation, order, and degree of the differential equation, types of differential equations, with real-world examples, and practice problems.</p>
            <p class="text-pad"><span>Learning Outcome: </span>It assess the strength and weakness of each of these models, interpret the mathematical equations from Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability Theory used in the learning models, implement efficient data analysis algorithms on a computer, and design test procedures in order to evaluate a model.</p>
